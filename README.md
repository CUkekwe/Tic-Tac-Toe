# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic tac toe game made using vanilla javascript

The game currently defaults to the player using "X" as player 1 and the player using "O" as a player 2 but I'm interested in adding functionality that will allow the players to name themselves and / or pick the symbol they use. For the meantime it works as intended.
